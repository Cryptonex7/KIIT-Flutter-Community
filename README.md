# KIIT Flutter Community:
### WHAT is it?
The objective of this group is to build awareness of OpenSource contributions in KIIT as it being one of the 3 most important fields of coding while using the (or about to be) the most famous cross platform development frameworks of all, Flutter.

### HOW do we do it?
- 🔸We will be posting UI Challenges every week. 
- 🔹With each UI Challenge, you will be supplied related resources to study and take help from. 
- 🔸There will be links to GitHub repositories for each Challenge where each of the participants will be submitting a Pull Request. 
- 🔹We will go through the results, and the best Submission will be merged into the master branch.
- 🔸We will be keeping track of your contributions and publishing the results here in the group.

### Out of the top Contributors, we will be selecting a few to get involved in a live, production project with a huge user base. This contribution, if significant, may also lead to university-wide recognition.

### WHY should you participate?
1. You get weekly challenges, so you are never out of practice.
2. Contribution to OpenSource has great perks (Look it up on Google!).
3. The Top Contributers selected for the project will be able to put the project on their CVs (It will be worth it!).
4. KIIT Lacks in students participating in domains such as competitive coding and/or OpenSource purely because of unawareness. 
Thus, through KFC, We will identify the most Skilled one's.

For the ones who are not at all familiar with Flutter, following our challenges will be the fastest way of learning - for sure.
